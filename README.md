Package dawg is an implemention of a Directed Acyclic Word Graph, as described
on my blog at http://stevehanov.ca/blog/?id=115

It is designed to be as memory efficient as possible. Instead of storing
a map in each node, which can consume hundreds of bytes, one map is
used to store the edges of all nodes.

When you are finished adding words, all unneeded information is
discarded.

In general, to use it you first create a builder using dawg.New(). You can then
add words to the Dawg. The two restrictions are that you cannot repeat a word, and
they must be in strictly increasing alphabetical order.

After all the words are added, call Finish() which returns a dawg.Finder interface.
You can perform queries with this interface, such as finding all prefixes of a given string
which are also words, or looking up a word's index that you have previously added.

After you have called Finish() on a Builder, you may choose to write it to disk using the
Save() function. The DAWG can then be opened again later using the Load() function.
When opened from dist, no memory is used. The structure is accessed in-place on disk.
